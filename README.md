## Access

To have access to this code and data:

1. Download this content to your local machine,
2. Download the data from [![DOI](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5072/zenodo.1040579.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5072/zenodo.1040579). For storage purposes the data files were not placed on GitHub,
3. Extract the files from data.zip to [./quantum-yield/data/](./quantum-yield/data/) folder,

## Running the scripts

Figures 3 and 4 from the [published paper](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.452874) were generated using the [system-characterization](./system-characterization/) code, which was built with Matlab. Figure 5 was generate with the [quantum-yield](./quantum-yield/) code, built with Python. Specific instructions on how to run each of them individually are available in their README files:

+ [Instructions](./system-characterization/README.md) for the system-characterization code
+ [Instructions](./quantum-yield/README.md) for the quantum-yield code
